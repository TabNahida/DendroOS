## Introduction
This project is a simple operating system made in c plus plus.

In this project, I am trying to make a operating system that have basic function and availability to run [Dendro]() program.
Also, there will be a web server available on this system.
The final goal of this project is to build an akasha system. And this is operating system for the akasha terminal.

I have studied how to build a operating system from WYOOS [Write your own operating system](https://github.com/AlgorithMan-de/wyoos/blob/master/makefile) and [MonkOS](https://github.com/beevik/MonkOS).

Name Dendro OS is come from an [element](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dendro) in game Genshin Impact.
